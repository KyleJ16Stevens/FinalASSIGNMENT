            <p class="pictureText">Fishing has always played a big part in my life growing up, I grew up on the South Shore of
                Nova Scotia outside of a small town called Liverpool in a village called Milton. Most of my family on my Fathers
                side fish so growing up I was always fishing, as I've grown up I've had less and less time to fish but it's still
                one of my favorite past times. Above I've linked a youtube video about the type of fishing I do the most, which is
                smallmouth bass fishing.

                </ul>
            </nav>

            <p class="pictureText">Hiking is a hobby my friends got me into after the COVID-19 lockdown, it's something
                I never really did pre-lockdown but now it's something I try my best to do whenever I can. Unfortunately
                this past year I didn't get out nearly as much as I'd hope too becuase the job I had was a shift work
                schedule. Most of my favorite trails are ones that run along the ocean but I dont mind ones more inland
                either, a trailed I'd like to try is cape split and if I had to say Duncans cove trail is probably my
                favorite. Linked above is that trail.

            <p class="pictureText">Gaming has always been a huge part in my life it's something my older brother got me into
                at a super young age and I've been doing it ever sense. The games I played most growing up where some of the 
                Halo games, Halo 3 and Halo Reach to be exact. As I've got older I started to play more games on PC and the
                one I play the most without a doubt would be a game called Counter-Strike, it's a game I've sunk countless 
                hours into over the past 9 years and it's a game I've meet some of my cloest friends playing. I've Linked
                a website above about a chairty LAN event called fragforcancer, Its an event me and some of my friends play
                almost every year even having one of the guys fly in from Colorodo, with any luck everyone from the team will
                be available we'll get to go again this year.
